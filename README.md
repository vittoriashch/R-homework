## [EDA of Airline Transport Data](https://github.com/vittoriashch/R-homework/blob/main/hw1.Rmd)
### Overview
This project explores airline transportation data with a focus on exploratory data analysis (EDA). The primary goal is to identify key insights about passenger traffic, trends in transportation, and potential factors influencing air travel patterns.

### Features

* Data Cleaning: Removal of null values and outliers for accurate analysis.
* Descriptive Statistics: Overview of data distributions and basic statistical metrics.
* Visualization: Comprehensive data visualization, including time-series graphs, histograms, and correlation heatmaps.
* Hypothesis Testing: Statistical tests to validate assumptions about the data.
## Tools Used
* R: Main programming language for data processing and visualization.
* ggplot2: Used for data visualization.
* dplyr: For efficient data manipulation.
### Insights
Significant fluctuations in passenger traffic during specific seasons.
Correlation between passenger numbers and external factors like fuel prices.
Key routes and their traffic patterns.
